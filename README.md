# The-forecasting-of-future-price-of-commodities-based-on-logistic-regression
a deep learning model based on logistic regression to forecast the price in next few days. 
The dataset was proovided by China UnionPay, which contains the price of commodities collected from all over China in 2022. Due to the confidentiality agreement, we cannot provide the dataset here.
The model used deep learning to forecast the price of some commodities. The loss may be a little higher due to the lack of some important data, so this code is only a practice and do not use it to forecast the real world.
The other part is a new part to forecast. In this part we use the same model to predict the number of people to take subway in shanghai.This part is called new_part and the data is uploaded.
